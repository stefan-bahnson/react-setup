Install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
Install webpack and dev tools https://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html  

Go to project root and type the following command in the terminal to install dependencies: `npm install`  
When done, type `npm start` and open a web-browser at <http://localhost:3333/>  

The browser will keep track of your updates when saving so `ctrl + s` is your friend here.
