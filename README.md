# react-setup
This project is meant to get you up and running without worring about the environment setup.  
I've included an example app to help you get started so  
dive in and start creating!  

### What you get
Full stack setup with `React`, `Redux`, `React Redux`, `Thunk Middleware` and `React Router`. 

# Requirements
Install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
Install webpack and dev tools https://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html  

### Getting Started
Go to the project root and type the following command in the command line to install dependencies: `npm install`  
When done, type `npm start` and open a web-browser at <http://localhost:3333/>  

# Inbox Example App
The included example is a basic app meant to show how `React`, `Redux` and `React Router` work together.  

Webpack will push changes to the browser and refresh your application as you make changes.  
`ctrl + s` is your friend here.
